        <h3>Lecturers</h3>
        <p>
            Lecturers can capture their monthly claims based on hours worked and hourly
            rates. Supporting documents can be uploaded to validate submissions.

        <p>
            Coordinators verify lecturer claims for accuracy and pre-approve them before
            escalation. They act as the first line of review in the approval process.

    <article class="role-card">
        <h3>Program Manager</h3>
        <p>
            Managers make the final decision to approve or reject claims, ensuring
            compliance with institutional policies and fairness across submissions.
